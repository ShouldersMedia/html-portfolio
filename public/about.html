<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alicia Shoulders, I have been in a career selling capital equipment for the food and beverage industry for 17 years. 
  It has been a fantastic career but now it is time for me to start trying new things. </p>

<p>I decided to take up coding about a month ago and have been exploring several different methods 
  to self-teach myself how to become a full-stack web developer. 
  Everything changed when I found Angela Yu~s class on Udemy. </p>

<p>I have put together this website to show the projects I have been able to create so far with my learning. 
  <br />Stay tuned as there will be more to come!</p
